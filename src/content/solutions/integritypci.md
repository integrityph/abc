view_text: IntegrityPCI gives comfort and assurance to the customers by making sure that every call they make is secured and their credit card data are protected. IntegrityPCI guarantees that only the customer should have access to their credit card information. It is never shared to anyone. The staff can never hear or see the credit card information of the customer during phone transaction. Though the whole conversation is recorded, the card data never is, which positively impacts organization that follows recording policy from various bodies to some circumstances.
